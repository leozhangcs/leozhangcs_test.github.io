I used to work on Chaotic Cryptography (inactive since 2015) and Compressed Sampling Secrecy (inactive since 2016), and my current research interests are __Trustworthy AI__ and __Applied Cryptography__.
<br><br><br>

**Trustworthy AI**: 
Given the critical importance of trust and transparency in AI technologies, addressing security and privacy challenges associated with AI deployment becomes paramount. My research in this area focuses on the following several key aspects: 
- Understanding and improving adversarial robustness <span style="color:blue"> [Oakland'24a], [Oakland'24c], [ICCV'23], [Asia CCS'23a], [CVPR'22] </span>  
- Deisning and defeating poisoning attacks <span style="color:blue"> [IJCAI'24a], [IJCAI'24b], [AAAI'24a], [Oakland'24b], [Acm MM'23], [IJCAI'23], [IJCAI'22] </span>  
- Preventing privacy and IP leakage <span style="color:blue"> [AAAI'24b], [AAAI'24c], [Asia CCS'23b] </span>  
- Improving overall performance in the presence of adversaries <span style="color:blue"> [TIFS'23] </span>
